# CTF_Coordinator_Task
Hi, I'm Ajitesh, 2nd year CSE (2019103503).
This is my work for the Web and App Coordinator Task.

#### Task Scenario:
Hotel Muruga Bhavan is a popular traditional multi-cuisine restaurant chain. They’ve been really
popular among foodies in the town. Sadly money and profits from their business venture blinded
them from using the power of technology in their business. Due to the pandemic, they’ve had
terrible losses due to lockdown and have lost their regular customers to their competitors who
use online portals for accepting food orders. To help regain the market, they’ve decided to
create an online portal for their restaurant chain and revive their once, thriving business and
have hired you as a developer to create a website for them, giving you the following
requirements.

#### Basic Functional Requirements:
● A Landing Page that talks about the legacy of Muruga Bhavan

● A Menu page highlighting the special dishes that are popular and signature to Muruga
Bhavan
